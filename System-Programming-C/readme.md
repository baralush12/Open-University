# Assembler-Open-University
This repository contains an assembler project developed as part of the Open University coursework.
Grade of 100.

# Overview
The project is written in C and consists of various modules that work together to perform the assembly process. The main components of the project include:

**Action Module (action.c):** Handles specific actions related to the assembly process.

**Checktxt Module (checktxt.c):** Validates and checks the provided text.

**Createfiles Module (createfiles.c):** Responsible for creating necessary files.

**Error Handling (error.c and error.h):** Manages and reports errors encountered during the assembly process.

**First Pass (fpass.c):** Performs the first pass of the assembly process.

**Function Definitions (function.h):** Contains function declarations and definitions.

**Global Definitions (global.h):** Contains global variables and constants.

**Main Module (main.c):** The entry point of the program.

**Preprocessor (prepro.c):** Handles preprocessing tasks.

**Second Pass (spass.c):** Performs the second pass of the assembly process.

**Structfunc Module (structfunc.c):** Manages data structures and related functions.

**Utilities (utils.c):** Contains utility functions used across the project.

# Building the Project
The project comes with a Makefile that can be used to compile and build the project. To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run:
make

# Usage
